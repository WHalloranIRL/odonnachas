## Design

### Font

In order to get a nice feel and complementary fonts I used (https://fonts.google.com/) in order to select the best fonts I felt for the page. Using (https://fonts.google.com/) I added the following fonts - Poppins

### Colors

Using the current color set of the bar, I chose a color pallete using (https://coolors.co/)

### Icons

### Structure

Based on current user experiences, I am choosing to go with a Mobile first approach. Using a single scrollable page with snap scrolling. I will modeling on iPhone 15 & Glaxay S20. I will be using breakpoints to make the page responsive for larger screens.

## Wireframes

Using Figma I have created initially the mobile first look and feel then scaled based on larger screen requirements
